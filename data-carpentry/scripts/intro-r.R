area_hectares <- 1.0 # assign 1.0 to an object called area_hectares
area_hectares # typing the name of the object prints the value

2.47 * area_hectares # convert area into acres

2.47 * area_hectares # convert into acres again

area_acres <- 2.47 * area_hectares # store area in acres in a new object
